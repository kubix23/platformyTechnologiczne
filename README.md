# Lab5

This exercise involves creating a few functions that do task parallel. 

## 1

In first exercise, I created three functions. They do same thing (calculate Newton's symbol) but in different ways.
1. First function uses Task class to create new thread and calculate nominator and denominator asynchronous.
2. Second function uses delegates for asynchronous method invocation.
3. Third function uses async-await function 

## 2

Calculate i-th term of the Fibonacci sequence. I use to this BackgroundWorker class and after every iteration update Progress Bar.

## 3

Compression and decompression parallel. 

## 4

Parallel mapping addresses to IP. Parallel LINQ was used for this.
